[crafting{200,15,key=item/openblocks.devnull}]











Click using /dev/null to open the inventory.
There's a single inventory slot - put an item in there - [link{block/dirt}]dirt [link{}], for example. As you gather dirt from the ground this slot will fill up.
Once it's full, any more dirt you pick up will be automatically discarded.
You can shift-click with the item in your hand as though you were placing the block!
