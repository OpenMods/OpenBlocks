Paint brushes let you paint blocks in whatever color you like!

Dab your paint brush in a [link{block/openblocks.paintcan}]Paint Can [link{}]made in the [link{block/openblocks.paintmixer}]Paint Mixer [link{}]then click on a block to paint it.
[link{block/openblocks.canvas}]Canvas blocks [link{}]are perfect for painting, but you can also paint quite a few vanilla blocks and even some blocks from other mods.
You can also place [link{item/openblocks.stencil}]stencils [link{}]on blocks and then paint over the stencil!
