[crafting{200,15,key=block/openblocks.elevator}]











Place one elevator directly three or more blocks above another with no blocks in between and you'll be able to either 'jump' to move up, or 'crouch' to move down.
Elevators can be dyed by clicking on them with [link{item/dyePoweder}]dye [link{}], however, you can only teleport between elevators of the same color.

Elevators can also rotate the player, but to be able to do that, you need to use a [link{block/openblocks.elevator_rotating}]Rotating Elevator [link{}].
