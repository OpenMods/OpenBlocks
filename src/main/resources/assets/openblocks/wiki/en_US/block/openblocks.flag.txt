[crafting{200,15,key=block/openblocks.flag}]











Flags can be used for decoration or for marking the way back out of a cave you've ventured in to.
The flag will point in the direction that you placed it, or you can put it on walls.

If you shift-click with a flag in your hand it will change color.
