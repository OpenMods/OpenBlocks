[crafting{200,15,key=block/openblocks.elevator_rotating}]











Place one elevator directly three or more blocks above another with no blocks in between and you'll be able to either 'jump' to move up, or 'crouch' to move down.
Elevators can be dyed by clicking on them with [link{item/dyePoweder}]dye [link{}], however, you can only teleport between elevators of the same color.
On teleport, these types of elevator also rotate the player. To disable this functionality, you need to use a [link{block/openblocks.elevator}]Normal Elevator [link{}].
