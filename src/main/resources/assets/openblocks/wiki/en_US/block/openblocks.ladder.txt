[crafting{200,15,key=block/openblocks.ladder}]











The jaded ladder solves that annoying problem of jumping out of a [link{block/trapdoor}]trapdoor [link{}]at the top of a [link{block/ladder}]ladder [link{}].
The jaded ladder acts as both a [link{block/trapdoor}]trapdoor [link{}]and a [link{block/ladder}]ladder [link{}]at the same time.
