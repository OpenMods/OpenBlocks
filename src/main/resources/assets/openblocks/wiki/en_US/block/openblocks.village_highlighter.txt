[crafting{200,15,key=block/openblocks.village_highlighter}]











Drop the village highlighter down in a village and give it a [link{item/redstone}]redstone [link{}]signal.
It will outline the perimeter of the village and draw a box in the [link{entities/VillagerGolem}]iron golem [link{}]spawning area.

Useful if you want to make sure villages don't merge into each other or you're making an iron farm!
