[crafting{200,15,key=block/openblocks.autoanvil}]











The auto anvil works just like [link{item/anvil.intact}]the vanilla anvil, [link{}]except it runs from [link{block/openblocks.xp_juice}]XP juice [link{}]and can be fully automated.

Use the tabs on the right of the GUI to select which sides of the anvil items or liquid can be inserted or extracted.
Right click and drag the anvil in the tab to spin it around and select other sides!
